## Tutorial

- Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/)
- Open command prompt and run this command `npm install discord.js-selfbot-v13 ws node-fetch`
- Open `Server.js` and input your token between the two `'` of the first line, [How do i get my token?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69868564/22794987)
- In command prompt, run `node Server.js` and wait for it to say "Ready!"
- Open Roblox, Inject your executor, and execute the script in `Connect.luau`

You can now execute [Dark Dex V4](https://github.com/LorekeeperZinnia/Dex) and double click any script. It might take 3-5 seconds for it to decompile.
